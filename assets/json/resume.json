Renewable energy poses as an attractive alternative with sources like solar energy being ubiquitous. Solar systems, however, have low conversion efficiency which causes a low power output. This is countered by using a Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT) which employs selected algorithms to operate the photovoltaic (PV) array (Voc=36.3V, Isc=7.84A per module) to extract maximum power. This paper presents a relative analysis of the Perturb & Observe (P&O) method and soft computing-based Fuzzy logic algorithms with five and seven linguistic variables under changing conditions of irradiation and temperature. In addition to this, the results of different membership functions employed in the fuzzy logic algorithm are further analyzed and presented."}],"skills":[{"name":"Physics","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Quantum Mechanics","Quantum Computing","Quantum Information","Quantum Cryptography","Quantum Communication","Quantum Teleportation"]}],"languages":[{"language":"German","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""},{"language":"English","fluency":"Fluent","icon":""}],"interests":[{"name":"Physics","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag","keywords":["Quantum Mechanics","Quantum Computing","Quantum Information","Quantum Cryptography","Quantum Communication","Quantum Teleportation"]}],"references":[{"name":"Professor John Doe","icon":"fa-solid fa-laptop","reference":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
