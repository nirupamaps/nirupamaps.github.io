Reserves of conventional sources are rapidly depleting, with an environmental crisis due to profligate consumption. Distributed generation through renewable sources and microgrids have proved as sustainable alternatives. Microgrids provide versatile topologies with dispersed generation and provision for expansion. However, the nonconventionality of microgrids pose challenges and the conventional control and protection strategy have proven unsuitable. This paper attempts to be a review of microgrids, challenges, and existing protection schemes. The first segment of this paper presents the definition and overview of the microgrid market scenario. The next segment discusses microgrid classification and control strategies, following which challenges, and protection schemes are reviewed. The paper concludes with an overview of relay coordination, optimization algorithms, and an outline of few international microgrid standards and codes."},{"name":"Pole-to-Pole Fault Detection Algorithm Using Energy Slope for Microgrids","publisher":"IEEE","releaseDate":"2022-04-13","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9752299","summary":"Recent global traction towards meeting energy demand through renewable resources due to ecological, resource depletion, and fiscal concerns has led to increased development in distributed energy generation. Microgrids have proven as promising solutions for energy generation due to their flexible yet robust topology with various control strategies. The main challenges with microgrids are associated with bidirectional flow of power and renewable injection at various points of the microgrid. Most protection schemes used in conventional utility grids are less effective against faults and disturbances in microgrids. Further, the inherent intermittency of renewable resources can make microgrid protection challenging. The work in this paper comprises of literature review of microgrids, fault analysis, and protection schemes employed for power systems. This paper aims to cover the simulation and fault analysis of DC (Direct Current) Pole-to-Pole faults in an islanded radial DC solar-based microgrid of two sources and three loads. Further, a fault detection algorithm using the energy slope values is proposed, implemented, and analyzed with respect to the system under consideration."},{"name":"Comparative Analysis of Traditional and Soft Computing Techniques of MPPT in PV Applications","publisher":"IEEE","releaseDate":"2021-11-02","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9573876/","summary":"Rising global population has led to a surge in energy demand which has been met by conventional sources of energy such as coal and natural gas hitherto, which has led to a stark depletion of these resources and they are environmentally extravagant. Renewable energy poses as an attractive alternative with sources like solar energy being ubiquitous. Solar systems, however, have low conversion efficiency which causes a low power output. This is countered by using a Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT) which employs selected algorithms to operate the photovoltaic (PV) array (Voc=36.3V, Isc=7.84A per module) to extract maximum power. This paper presents a relative analysis of the Perturb & Observe (P&O) method and soft computing-based Fuzzy logic algorithms with five and seven linguistic variables under changing conditions of irradiation and temperature. In addition to this, the results of different membership functions employed in the fuzzy logic algorithm are further analyzed and presented."}],"skills":[{"name":"Physics","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Quantum Mechanics","Quantum Computing","Quantum Information","Quantum Cryptography","Quantum Communication","Quantum Teleportation"]}],"languages":[{"language":"German","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""},{"language":"English","fluency":"Fluent","icon":""}],"interests":[{"name":"Physics","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag","keywords":["Quantum Mechanics","Quantum Computing","Quantum Information","Quantum Cryptography","Quantum Communication","Quantum Teleportation"]}],"references":[{"name":"Professor John Doe","icon":"fa-solid fa-laptop","reference":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
